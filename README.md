# Pet feeder based on IOT

> **Abstract** : If you have a pet in your home and you don’t have anyone to feed it when you are away from home then you definitely need some kind of machine to do this job. So here we are building a IoT Pet Feeder machine which is simple, efficient and cost effective. Using this machine you can feed your Pet by Google Assistant from anywhere in the world. You just have to say "Okay Google. Feed my pet" and rest of the things will be done by this machine. You can also set a specific time using Google Assistant to feed your Pet. For example Say "Okay Google. Feed my pet Today Morning" and it will feed your pet at previously specified time. Like this you can also set a specific time for noon and evening.
